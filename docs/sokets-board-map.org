*BBB don't boot if out-board is plug on slots 0,1,2 as [2015-10-14 Wed]*



the SYSBOOT pins, which are also the LCD_DATA pins, are located on the
headers from P8:31 to P8:46. The pins are used to index the device
table from which the list of devices is extracted.Any error that
occurs in reading the value of these pins sends the ROM boot code into
a loop, waiting for the watchdog to reset the system.

These pins can be used by software after ROM execution has
completed. So, we can't have anything connected to these pins when the
ROM code is executing.

*****  I2C (from some source, not tested)
 - I2C0: used for some on-board components (HDMI, EEPROM, power
   mgmt). Not brought out to any connector/header
 - I2C2: entirely free to use, and works
 - I2C1: entirely free to use, but doesn't seem to be enabled

NOTE: In software, the busses are numbered differently; I2C2 is
identified as 1. I2C0 is identified as 0.

***** SPI Definition
Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) is a synchronous serial data
protocol used by microcontrollers for communicating with one or more
peripheral devices quickly over short distances. It can also be used
for communication between two microcontrollers.

With an SPI connection there is always one master device (usually a
microcontroller) which controls the peripheral devices. Typically
there are three lines common to all the devices:

    - MISO (Master In Slave Out) - The Slave line for sending data to
      the master,
    - MOSI (Master Out Slave In) - The Master line for sending data to
      the peripherals,
    - SCK (Serial Clock) - The clock pulses which synchronize data
      transmission generated by the master and one line specific for
      every device:
    - SS (Slave Select) - the pin on each device that the master can
      use to enable and disable specific devices.
