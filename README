* This is another domotics project
    - it is based on Beaglebone Black
    - Its able to control up to 64 Inputs or Outputs in blocks of 4
    - I've developed a main board were is possible to plug up to 16
      4-inputs or 4-outputs boards (4 GPIOs). All of them are
      optocoupled.
      - I've already developed a 4-relays board and 4-transistors
        board wich can control lights intensity by PWM and also
        4-imputs board
    - The power board can be connected to a battery and detect a mains
      failure
    - It's already able to comunicate with Openhab, an android ios
      application
    - It's in production now since April 8th 2016 in my home
    - There is also 2 more slots with 3 and 4 analogs inputs, I'm
      planing to sense the battery level and natural light level.
    - Into one of the 16 slots I'm planing to connect some DS18B20 (up
      to 10 can be connected to one gpio) to sense the rooms
      temperatures.

* This is my first project to be published
  I'm trying to sort thins out to make them easier to understan

  Will re-write some of c++ objects to make them clear to understand

* What is now running
  - A full functional project is in production at my home
  - Now I'm controlling 5 PWM circuits for lights
  - I've also 5 inputs
  - All outputs are controlled by Openhab web application from LAN/WAN

* What is still to be done

** Electronics

** Software

** General/Project


* How to test this project
  - Get a Beagle bone black with Linux running
  - do :: apt-get install build-essential
  - do :: apt-get install linux-image-3.8.13-bone68 device-tree-compiler
    - to be able to compile new capes, they are needed to manage GPIOs
  - compile the cape /domotics/capes/half-in-half-pru.dts
    - copy the compiled code to /lib/firmware/
  - get yours electronics ready and connected to one of the gpio used
    on "on-production/test-pwm.cpp" like "GPIO 27"
  - Connect and input switch at "GPIO 4"
  - copy the contemns of "/domotics/on-production" to /pru2 at BBB
  - run /pru2/start.sh
  - Your led should get PWM controlled with the switch

  - Optional:
    If you want to run it with openhab for remote controll
    - Install libc-ares-dev uuid-dev libwrap0-dev libssl-dev needed by
      mosquitto library
    - Install mosquitto it can be downloaded here: http://mosquitto.org/download/
  - Install openhab, instructions at it's site: http://openhab.org/
    - copy /domotics/root/* to "/" at BBB
  - Install an configure your openhab to point to your BBB ip as http://BBBip:8080
